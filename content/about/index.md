Upon working on this website, there was a conscious effort to workshop or create a meaning for the title, "Blaster Blade." The name itself was inspired by a character from the card game Vanguard from within the game itself. Shortly, the decision to use it was spontaneous, and that realization gave an answer.

The name was conceived like a blast, a simple thud that says "yes"--it was spontaneous. Okay, but what about blade? If you would humor me, the blade component is the biproduct of that blast, like a blade which was the work of a smith from days when men were measured by the sword and not the pen. It is, analogously, spontaneous inspiration begetting output, as this really is just a blog meant for writing practice.

That is, if you'll humor me.
